SAGS (Secure Administrator of Game Servers) is a client-server
application to administer game servers on GNU/Linux using a SSL
connection.

The main idea is to provide a open source solution to GameHost by Xoanan
Industries but it must work on GNU/Linux. It must provide a robust
interface to manage the game server remotely. The major features will
be:

 - The server must run as a system daemon, it will have its own users
   list and will provide an authetication method for the clients.

 - A SSL/TLS based network protocol to permit the server and client to
   transfer securely the game information and administration data.

 - The client must provides a easy interface to the user. It will be
   portable to Windows platform.

I writed the client and the server in C++ using the OpenSSL libraries
for network communication. The server works like a daemon and have its
own users list. Actually the server runs only on Linux because I don't
have another SO to test it (I'm testing on Debian Sid and Fedora Core
1), but I think it will work on FreeBSD with minor modifications.

The client have the GUI writed with wxWidgets and also it uses OpenSSL
for network communication. Also it can be compiled with Dev-C++ to
obtain a Windows version.

Actually the client needs more development than the server. It needs a
toolbar with common operations like connect, disconnect, etc. Also the
network protocol needs more development. The authentication and some
commands of session have been developed, but it requires more commands
to control the game server.
