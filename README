Secure Administrator of Game Servers - SAGS Server
==================================================

SAGS (Secure Administrator of Game Servers) is a client-server
application to administer game servers on GNU/Linux using a SSL
connection.

The main idea is to provide a open source solution to GameHost by Xoanan
Industries but it must work on GNU/Linux. It must provide a robust
interface to manage the game server remotely.

The major features are:

 - The server run as a system daemon.

 - It have its own users list and provides an authetication method for
   the clients.

 - It uses a SSL/TLS based network protocol to transfer securely the
   game information and administration data.

 - It uses the OpenSSL libraries for network communication.

 - It can restart the process if it dies.

 - Stores a log of the process. It can be sent later to the clients.

Actually the server runs only on Linux because I don't have another SO
to test it (I'm testing on Debian Sid and Fedora Core 1), but I think it
will work on FreeBSD with minor modifications.
